In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).\nSingapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 should be used to prepare the analytical visualisation. The data can be downloaded here."

Note that in .shp file, the name of planning areas are in upper case. We need to edit the matching by Upper(PA) = PA(.shp file).\n\n\n\n3\nFiles are joined successfully.\n\n\n\n4\nDrop Geometry to the field.\n\n\n\n5\nDrag Pop to Color, PA to Label.\n\n\n\n6\nEdit the color. When we choose step 3 and modify the color of least population to light grey, the no. of highlighted region is 9.\n\n\n\n7\nEdit the label on the map. Select always show for Punggol and Bedok, and never show for the rest PA. We can annotate the two highlighted regions to facilitate understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Draw Pyramids of the 9 PAs and Display in Trellis (single diagram)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nStep\nScreenshot\n\n\n\n\n1\nManually sort the PA (name of planning areas) based on median age as we would like to control the arrangement of pyramids of PA in trellis.\n\n\n\n2\nThe 9 most populated PA are sorted, while the rest of PA are unchanged.\n\n\n\n3\nCreate a new parameter representing the number of columns in trellis. In this example, the parameter should be sqrt(9) = 3. Note that creating such parameter is to avoid hard code.\n\n\n\n4\nCreate a new calculated field named Index of each row.\n\n\n\n5\nCreate a new calculated field named Column Index of each row.\n\n\n\n6\nCreate a new calculated field named Row Index of each row. Note that the column index and row index will be used when we need to display the 9 pyramids in trellis (a single diagram containning many small plots). The two index serve the purpose as the coordinate of each small plot, such as (1,1) in the top left corner and (3,3) in the bottom right corner.\n\n\n\n7\nAs we would like to display partial data in trellis, we created a new calculated field called Group1 to group the 9 selected PA in one group,\n\n\n\n8\nThen we drop Group1, choose Attribute to filter and select ‘1’ only.\n\n\n\n9\nDue to space constrain, we create new age groups. In the original dataset, the step between consecutive age groups is 5. We increase it to 10. That is, we combine every 2 groups into 1, such as 0 to 4 and 5 to 9 into 0 to 9.\n\n\n\n\n10\nCreate new calculated field of population of males and females as shown.\n\n\n\n\n11\nDrop Row_Index, Male and Female into Columns.\nDrop Column_Index and AGE into Rows.\nDrop PA to Detail.\nNote that we need to modify the Row_Index and Column_Index by selecting computing using PA.\n\n\n\n12\nThen we drop the [Sex] to Colour, Rank of PA to Detail in Mark card of All. We can modify the color of sex by using blue to represent Male and Pink to represent Female.\n\n\n\n13\nModify the tooltip.\n\n\n\n14\nRearrange the order of age group on y axis.\n\n\n\n15\nAdd the label for the bar representing age group of 90+ for Males in each PA.\nFirst, select all bars and choose Mark Label -> Never Show.\nThen select the bars representing age group of 90+ and choose Mark Label -> Always Show.\n\n\n\n\n16\nThen add names of PA and median age of PA to Labels.\n\n\n\n17\nReverse the Male axis to build pyramid.\n\n\n\n\n18\nFormat of label by click the ‘…’ as shown on the screenshot.\nPlease note that in order for the label to appear on the top left corner, I specifically add a full stop of blue color after many empty spaces in the second line.\n\n\n\n19\nAdd the title of the worksheet.\nRemove the unnecessary headers to obtain the final view of the worksheet.\n\n\n\n20\nCreate a new worksheet to plot the pyramid of Singapore as a reference.\n\n\n\n21\nCreate a table showing the Old Age Support Ratio of each PA.\n\n\n\n22\nCreate a new dashboard and drop the worksheets to specific locations and adjust the width and height of each region.\nAdd Note, data source and update date.\n\n\n\n23\nPublish the dashboard. Note that we need to choose to Extract Data, instead of using Live Data.\n\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to read this article and paying attention to it."
