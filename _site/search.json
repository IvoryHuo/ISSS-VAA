In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).\nSingapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 should be used to prepare the analytical visualisation.

Note that in .shp file, the name of planning areas are in upper case. We need to edit the matching by Upper(PA) = PA(.shp file).\n\n\n\n3\nFiles are joined successfully.\n\n\n\n4\nDrop Geometry to the field.\n\n\n\n5\nDrag Pop to Color, PA to Label.\n\n\n\n6\nEdit the color.

Note that the column index and row index will be used when we need to display the 9 pyramids in trellis (a single diagram containning many small plots). The two index serve the purpose as the coordinate of each small plot, such as (1,1) in the top left corner and (3,3) in the bottom right corner.\n\n\n\n7\nAs we would like to display partial data in trellis, we created a new calculated field called Group1 to group the 9 selected PA in one group,\n\n\n\n8\nThen we drop Group1, choose Attribute to filter and select ‘1’ only.\n\n\n\n9\nDue to space constrain, we create new age groups. In the original dataset, the step between consecutive age groups is 5. We increase it to 10. That is, we combine every 2 groups into 1, such as 0 to 4 and 5 to 9 into 0 to 9.\n\n\n\n\n10\nCreate new calculated field of population of males and females as shown.\n\n\n\n\n11\nDrop Row_Index, Male and Female into Columns.\nDrop Column_Index and AGE into Rows.\nDrop PA to Detail.\nNote that we need to modify the Row_Index and Column_Index by selecting computing using PA.\n\n\n\n12\nThen we drop the [Sex] to Colour, Rank of PA to Detail in Mark card of All.

    "text": "Clarity\n\nThe title of dashboard is unclear. We are suppose to represent the distribution of a population by age and sex, but not ‘age pyramid: sex pattern’.\nThe number of Planning Areas (PA) should be 9, but not all.\nThere is no annotation, subtitles or note to tell data story. Central tendency measures such as median could be added to provide audience with better interpretation of the distribution.\nIn a population pyramid, males are usually shown on the left by blue and females are usually shown on the right by pink/red. In the diagram, the different gender are represented by the same color.\nThe label of the y-axis of age is misleading. The age group should be represented by an interval (0 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 29, …) instead of an integer(0,10,20,…). The order of age group is wrong. And it should no start at null and end at 80. In fact, the ‘Null’ in the example should represent the group ‘90_and_above’.\nThe label of the x-axis is hard to read. In fact, the gender can be represented by legend and the ‘population’ can be labeled just once on x-axis.\nThere is no update date and data source.\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe arrangement of pyramids is only in the diagonal of a matrix. The information is not displayed in one page as many space are wasted. We should display the 9 pyramids in 3 * 3 matrix. It enables us to make comparisons quickly and easily."
