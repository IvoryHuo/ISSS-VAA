# Task

To uncover the salient patterns of the resale prices of 3-room, 4-room and 5-room public housing property by residential towns and estates in Singapore.

We will use appropriate analytically visualisation techniques as well as interactive techniques to enhance user and data discovery experiences.

The data can be downloaded [here](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices).

# The Analysis and Codes
First load the r libraries.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot,plotly, crosstalk, DT, ggdist, zoo,gifski,ggiraph, gapminder, ggridges,gganimate,FunnelPlotR,knitr,tidyverse)

```

Load the data set and filter using the flat type as we only focus on the resale price of 3-room, 4-room and 5-room.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
#| message: false
prop_data <- read_csv("data/resale-flat-prices-based-on-registration-date-from-jan-2017-onwards.csv")
prop_data <- prop_data %>%
  filter(flat_type == '3 ROOM' | flat_type == '4 ROOM' |flat_type =='5 ROOM')
```
## 1. Transaction volume 
Let us first study the number of resale HDBs of different flat types from Jan 2017 to Feb 2023.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
p1 <- prop_data %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = prop_data$month)) +
  geom_bar_interactive(
    aes(tooltip = prop_data$month)
  )+
  theme_bw()+
  
  labs(title = "Monthly Sales Volume, from Jan 2017 to feb 2023", x = 'Time', y = 'Monthly Sales Volume',
       caption = "Singapore circuit breaker measures Â· 2020-04-07 to 2020-06-01 (1 month, 3 weeks, and 4 days)") +
  
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = '2020-04'),linetype = "dashed",color= 'red') +
  annotate("text",label = "Circular Break", x = "2019-11",y=1000) +


  facet_wrap(~flat_type, nrow = 3) 
  
girafe(
  ggobj = p1,
  width_svg = 6,
  height_svg = 6 * 0.618
)
```
Interactivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on the bar of interest, the respective month will be displayed.

Findings: During the 2 months of circular break, the number of HDB resale flat transactions dropped 80% and recovered as soon as possible after the circular break ends. The volume of transactions increased after the pandemic. The most popular type is the 4-room flats.

## 2. Resale Price of different flat types
### a.Trend

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
#| message: false

prop_data_p2 <- prop_data %>%
  separate(month, into = c("year", "month"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(flat_type,year) %>%
  summarise(ave_price = round(median(resale_price),1),
            transation_volume = n(),
            mean_size = round(mean(floor_area_sqm),1))

tooltip_p2 <- 
  c(paste( "Flat type:", prop_data_p2$flat_type,
           "\n Median resale price:" , prop_data_p2$ave_price,
           "\n Transaction volume:", prop_data_p2$transation_volume,
           "\n Mean size (sqm):", prop_data_p2$mean_size
  
))

p2 <-prop_data_p2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = ave_price,colour = flat_type))+
  geom_smooth(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_point_interactive(aes(tooltip = tooltip_p2),size = 5) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2017,2023,by = 1),limits = c(2017,2023)) +
  labs(title = "Resale Price of HDBs from 2017 to 2023", x = 'Year', y = 'Resale Price (SGD)')

girafe(
  ggobj = p2,
  width_svg = 12
)
```
Interactivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on the data point(solid dot on the lines) of interest, the tooltip will be displayed. The tooltip includes the derived statistics of the median resale price, transaction volume and mean size.

Findings: The resale flat prices were relatively stable between 2017 and 2020. For 3-room HDB, the price decreased slightly from 2017 to 2019. Then the prices for all the 3 types began to rise from 2020.
The difference of median transaction price between 3-room and 4-room is much larger than it between the 4-room and 5-room.

### b.ANOVA test of median price
Does the mean of the price per sqm differ among different flat types?
First, let us explore the distribution of the mean price per sqm for different flat types.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
#| message: false


prop_data_test1 <- prop_data %>%
  mutate(ave_price_per_sqm = round(resale_price/floor_area_sqm,1))

price_distribution <- prop_data_test1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ave_price_per_sqm,y = flat_type)) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(color = 'white') +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C") +
  theme_ggstatsplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Price", 
       x = "Mean of Price psm (SGD)", 
       y = "Flat Type") 
price_distribution
```

As the price per sqm of all three types skewed to left and does not follow a normal distribution, we use non-parametric anova test to compare the median of the price per sqm of 3 different flat types.



```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
#| message: false
t1 <- ggbetweenstats(
  data = prop_data_test1,
  x = flat_type,
  y = ave_price_per_sqm,
  type = "np",
  mean.ci = TRUE,
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE,
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)

t1
```
Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric method for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution. Null hypothesis assumes that the groups are from identical populations. Alternative hypothesis assumes that at least one group comes from a different population than the others.

Conclusion: From the pairwise test result, we can conclude that:
1. There is no difference between the median price per sqm of 3-room and 4-room.
2. There are differences between the median price per sqm of 3-room and 5-room, and of 4-room and 5-room.


## 3. Resale Price psm in different residential towns

### a. Overview
Plot the static ridgelines to show the distribution of average price/psm of flats from Jan 2017 to Feb 2023 in Singapore for each residential towns.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
#| message: false
 p3<- prop_data %>%
  group_by(town) %>%
  mutate(price_psm = resale_price/floor_area_sqm) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=price_psm, 
                       y = reorder(as.factor(town),-price_psm),
                       fill = after_stat(x)
                       )
         ) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient( color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C") +
  theme_bw() +
  
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "HDB resale prices by residential towns, 2017 - 2023 Singapore", 
       x = "Price psm (SGD)", 
       y = "Planning Area")
p3
```

We can conclude that the resale of HDB in the areas such as woodlands, choa chu kang, jurong west are transacted at lower average price. And the price clustered around the average of \$4000 psm.

While the price of resale HDB in Bukit merah, queenstown and central area not only have a higher price, but also scattered from \$4000 to \$12000.

In general, HDBs in residential towns having lower price tend to have a lower variability.

### b. Animation of Price changes over time 

Let us animate it.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ani1 <- prop_data %>%
  group_by(town) %>%
  mutate(price_psm = resale_price/floor_area_sqm) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(month,"-01", sep=""))) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=price_psm, 
                       y = reorder(as.factor(town),-price_psm),
                       fill = after_stat(x)
                       )
         ) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient( color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C") +
  theme_bw() +
  
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "HDB resale prices in {frame_time} Singapore", 
       x = "Price psm (SGD)", y = "") +
  
  transition_time(date)
  anim_save('price_animation.gif',ani1)

```

![Source: HDB of Singapore 2023](price_animation.gif)

From 2017 to 2020, the price is quite stable. Each curve stays at its original place. The shape of the curves with lower average price have much less change compares with those with higher average price.

However, from 2020 onwards, the curve starts to move to right. The average price almost increases by \$1000 from 2020 to 2023.


## 4. Features of the HDBs in Different Residential Towns
### a.Age of flats by flat type
Let us explore the remaining lease years of the HDB flats in different residential towns.
The age of HDB flat = 99 years - remaining lease years.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| warning: false
#| message: false
prop_data_p4<- prop_data %>%
  mutate(age = 99-as.integer(substr(prop_data$remaining_lease,0,2))) %>%
  group_by(town)

tooltip <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {   
  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy) 
  sem <- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy) 
  paste("Mean Age:", mean, "+/-", sem) 
}

gg_point <- ggplot(data=prop_data_p4, 
                   aes(x = reorder(town,age)),
) +
  stat_summary(aes(y = age, 
                   tooltip = after_stat(  
                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  
    fun.data = "mean_se", 
    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,
    fill = "lightblue"
    
  ) +
  stat_summary(aes(y = age),
    fun.data = mean_se,
    geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2, size = 0.2
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~flat_type)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw() +
  
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Age of HDBs by residential towns, 2017 - 2023 Singapore", 
       y = "Age (years)", 
       x = "Residential Town") 
  #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

girafe(ggobj = gg_point,
       width_svg = 8,
       height_svg = 8*0.618)


```

Interactivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on the bar of interest, the respective mean age and standard error of mean will be displayed.

We can conclude that the HDB at punggol, sengkang are relatively new compared with the flats in marine parade and bukit timah.
Moreover, 3-room flats are older than 4-room and 5-room flats.
