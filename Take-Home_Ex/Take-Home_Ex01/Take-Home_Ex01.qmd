# 1.Task

Age-sex pyramid is an analytical visualisation commonly used by demographers to reveal the structure of population by gender and age group. In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).

Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 should be used to prepare the analytical visualisation. The data can be downloaded [here](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data).

# 2.Visualisation

The proposed visualisation can be viewed on Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/huoda1027/viz/TakeHome_Ex01_16742612602400/Dashboard1?publish=yes).
